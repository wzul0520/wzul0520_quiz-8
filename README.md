In this quiz, I'll explore inspiring imaging techniques and their coding implementations. I'll choose an inspiring imaging technique, discuss its relevance briefly, and find a coding technique to match.

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

The city bending scene in "Inception" grabs attention by twisting the city in unexpected ways, like bending reality itself. It feels dreamy, like you're not quite sure what's real. The mix of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and real-life footage is seamless, making it all the more impressive. I'm inspired by the scene's mind-bending visuals and seamless integration of CGI with live-action footage. Applying the city bending effect to Nasreen Mohamedi's 'untitled-1' allows for the exploration of spatial distortion and the abstraction of architectural forms, adding a layer of intrigue and complexity to the composition.
