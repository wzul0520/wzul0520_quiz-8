In this quiz, I'll explore inspiring imaging techniques and their coding implementations. I'll choose an inspiring imaging technique, discuss its relevance briefly, and find a coding technique to match.

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

The city bending scene in "Inception" grabs attention by twisting the city in unexpected ways, like bending reality itself. It feels dreamy, like you're not quite sure what's real. The mix of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and real-life footage is seamless, making it all the more impressive. I'm inspired by the scene's mind-bending visuals and seamless integration of CGI with live-action footage. Applying the city bending effect to Nasreen Mohamedi's 'untitled-1' allows for the exploration of spatial distortion and the abstraction of architectural forms, adding a layer of intrigue and complexity to the composition.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
The GLSL shader code here crafts a mesmerizing visual vibe influenced by the city bending scene in Inception. The code utilizes mathematical functions to manipulate pixels' positions and colors dynamically, creating a distorted and abstract representation. By understanding how it works, I can attempt to make the selected artwork resemble the city bending effect in the movie. In doing so, I intend to create a surreal and captivating visual experience that captures the essence of the film's mind-bending scenes.
